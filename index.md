# Graph Plotter 

This project/repository contains programs for plotting graphs of various functions including *polynomial* , *trignometric* , *exponentiation* and *logarithmic functions* using **Turtle/Matplotlib** along with **Tkinter**.



## Overview 

The following project had been initiated as an experimental project to test turtle's feasibility in plotting 2D graphs of various types of functions.
Project slowly transposed into a **Graph Plotting Software** which currently(in latest version) uses tkinker and matplotlib .
